# Restaurant Reviews App

This project converts a static webpage to a mobile-ready and responsive web application. 

## Instructions
* open `config.js` in your editor and replace `<YOUR_KEY>` with your Google Maps API Key 
* move `config.js` to the root directory of your project 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
* load the application at `http://localhost:8000`
